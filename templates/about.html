              After finishing school in 1998 (Bachelor of Business Administration) I started my first job at
              Baan Business Innovation. Here we developed methodologies and tools to simplify and speed-up ERP
              implementations. Looking back, this job defined the direction of my career â€“ aligning people,
              processes, systems and data. I realized however that I needed to develop additional skills
              and wanted to see different companies.

              In 1999 I started a two year Management Trainee-ship at Ormit. My first eight month assignment was
              at Royal Dutch Airforce in a PMO role. After that I got my hands dirty on SAP for the first time at ASML.
              As a member of the New Product Introduction team I worked hands-on with SAP to provide logistics support
              to a development team from design to mass production phase. For my last assignment I joined a European
              SAP implementation project for the ambient food and margarine division at Unilever. This is where I found
              my calling!

            <p class="mb-2">
              When I left Ormit I joined Unilever to continue working on the previously mentioned project as an inhouse
              consultant. In 2003, after successful implementations in The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland, I was asked
              to join Unilever NL as a team lead in the Supply & Demand Planning department. This was an amazing
              experience, but after two years I realized SAP consulting and project work is what I wanted to do.

            <p class="mb-2">
              In 2005 I re-joined the European SAP project. A year later Unilever decided to outsource the project
              to Accenture. I transferred to Accenture but after six years at Unilever I wanted to broaden my
              horizon and see other companies. I joined ITVisors in 2007, but I was immediately hired back to
              Accenture to continue my work at Unilever. Only in 2008 I said goodbye to Unilever after having
              implemented SAP in 15 countries.
